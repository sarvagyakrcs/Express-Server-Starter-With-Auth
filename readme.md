# NetConnect

## Description

The NetQuery Hub leverages concepts from both discrete mathematics and computer networks to offer a comprehensive tool for web developers, particularly those who are not deeply familiar with network analytics. By allowing users to query network performance data in natural language, the project makes advanced network analysis accessible and actionable. The use of a vector database enhances the ability to perform complex queries and retrieve information efficiently, thus empowering developers to optimize their web applications based on precise, data-driven insights.
Data Flow and Interactions:
1. Uploading and Parsing .HAR Files: The user uploads a .HAR file via a form on the Next.js frontend. The backend receives the .HAR file, parses it using a custom Node.js script, and extracts relevant data (e.g., request timings, sizes, statuses).
2. Data Storage: Non-vectorized data (user data, basic request logs) is stored in PostgreSQL for transactional integrity and relational queries.
Important metrics and features extracted from the .HAR file are vectorized (possibly using techniques like feature hashing or embeddings) and stored in a vector database for efficient query performance and similarity searches.
3. Query Processing with LangChain: The frontend allows users to type natural language queries about their data.
These queries are sent to the backend, where LangChain processes the queries to understand intent and context.
LangChain, integrated via its SDK in the Node.js application, communicates with the vector database or PostgreSQL as needed, depending on the query. For instance, if a query involves finding similar performance issues, it hits the vector database; if itâ€™s about user settings or historical data, it queries PostgreSQL.
4. Response and Visualization: The backend aggregates the responses from LangChain and the databases and sends the data back to the frontend.
The frontend displays this data in a user-friendly format, allowing the developer to make informed decisions based on the insights provided.
